Land Surface Temperature data

data source: MODIS...
     - Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1km (MOD11A1/MYD11A1)
     or
     - Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity 8-Day L3 Global 1km (MOD11A2/MYD11A2)

ideally, retrieve 8-Day product from both Terra and Aqua,
but 4 days apart to get quasi-4-daily coverage

data access:
     - ModisDownload.R
     (http://r-gis.net/?q=ModisDownload)
     
MODIS tiles: h18v3 and h18v4, so h=18; v=c(3,4)
