This is a list of tasks to be done in order to develop
     	       	  	MappaFunghi
an android-app displaying funghi distribution following
key environmental constraints.

1) key inputs:		resolution:
   - soil type		vector data, major soil types resolved
   - vegetation type	1 km
   - soil moisture	1 km
   - topography		1 km
   - temperature	10 km 

2) tasks
   - get all input data sets required
     - soil type   	done (source: ???)
     - vegetation type	done (source: ???)
     - soil moisture	done (source: ???)
     - topography	pending
     - temperature	pending
     - phenological information (database)
   - convert input data to format required
     - raster data: GeoTiff
       - soil moisture: BUFR -> NetCDF4 -> GeoTiff (R script)
     - vector data: shapefiles
   - write script to retrieve updated data on a regular basis:
     - soil moisture: every 3-5 days
     - temperature:   daily
   - clip datasets to study area extent (Germany): 
     - N: 55.0585 degrees -> 55.6
     - S: 47.2703 degrees -> 46.7
     - E: 15.0419 degrees -> 15.6
     - W:  5.8667 degrees ->  5.3 
   - remapping to one common projection
     - determine projection type: WGS? UTM? Gauss-Krueger?
   - merge datasets within QGIS:
     - combine raster and vector information,
       rasterize vector data if necessary
     - for each pixel, information is required for:
       - soil type: acidic, alcalic? boolean 
       - vegetation type: non-forested, broadleaf, evergreen? boolean
       - soil moisture: SWC above threshold value for > 2 weeks? boolean
       - phenology: growing season? boolean
